localStorage.getItem() is a method provided by the web browser's localStorage object that retrieves the value stored under a specific key. In this case, it retrieves the value stored under the key "todos".
|| is a logical OR operator in JavaScript. If the value returned by localStorage.getItem("todos") is null, undefined, or any other "falsy" value, then the || operator causes the empty array to be assigned to todos instead. */

The first thing that this function does is clear any existing to-do items that may be displayed on the webpage. It does this by setting the innerHTML property of the todoList element to an empty string.

innerHTML is a property of an element in the Document Object Model (DOM) that represents the content of the element, including any HTML tags and text. By setting it to an empty string, the function effectively removes any content that may have been previously displayed in the todoList element.

Next, a label element, an input checkbox element, an edit button element, and a delete button element are created using the document.createElement() method, and assigned to their respective constants (label, checkbox, editBtn, and deleteBtn).

The label element's textContent property is set to the text of the current to-do item.
The editBtn element's textContent property is set to "Edit", the "edit-btn" class is added to it, and an event listener is added to it that displays a prompt asking the user to enter new text for the corresponding to-do item.
The deleteBtn element's textContent property is set to "Delete", the "delete-btn" class is added to it, and an event listener is added to it that deletes the corresponding to-do item from the list when clicked.
Finally, the li element is populated with the checkbox, label, edit button, and delete button elements, and added to the todoList element on the webpage. If the to-do item is marked as done, the completed class is added to the li element.
